A comprehensive, interactive web application for analyzing campus climate survey data with advanced statistical analysis, data visualization, and insights generation.

## Description

The Campus Climate Survey Analysis Dashboard is a React-based web application designed to help educational institutions analyze and visualize campus climate survey data. The dashboard provides interactive tools for exploring inclusivity, safety, supportiveness, and satisfaction metrics across different demographic groups and academic programs.

### Problem Solved
Educational institutions often struggle to effectively analyze and present campus climate survey data in a meaningful way. This dashboard addresses this challenge by providing:
- Real-time data filtering and analysis
- Statistical significance testing
- Interactive visualizations
- Actionable insights and recommendations
- Professional reporting capabilities

### Dashboard Navigation

The dashboard is organized into four main sections:

#### 1. **Overview Tab**
- View summary statistics with confidence intervals
- See score distribution across key metrics
- Monitor key performance indicators

#### 2. **Analysis Tab**
- Select variables to analyze (Inclusivity, Safety, Supportiveness, Satisfaction)
- Choose comparison groups (Gender, Academic Program, Academic Year)
- View statistical test results and significance levels

#### 3. **Insights Tab**
- Read detailed interpretations of findings
- Review recommendations for improvement
- Understand limitations and assumptions

#### 4. **Advanced Tab**
- Explore scatter plots for correlation analysis
- View trend analysis with line charts
- Compare current scores against target benchmarks

### Data Filtering

Use the filter controls to:
- Filter by academic program (Computer Science, Engineering, etc.)
- Filter by gender identity
- Filter by academic year
- Filter by student organization membership

### Interpreting Results

- **Confidence Intervals**: Show the range where the true population mean likely falls
- **P-values**: Indicate statistical significance (< 0.05 is significant)
- **Effect Sizes**: Measure practical significance (Cohen's d > 0.5 is medium effect)
- **Sample Sizes**: Ensure adequate power for statistical tests
